    "The purpose of this notebook is to show how to annotate (label) multivariate time-series data by using interactive widgets available in Matploblib. The tool leverages two classes: TimeSeries and PreAnnotator. The first one encapsulates the time series data and the methods to manipulate it. The latter is an auxiliary class to pre-annotate the data with a custom logic. In the case of drilling data, for example, this pre-annotation logic consists of a first-order logic inference tool. <br>\n"
